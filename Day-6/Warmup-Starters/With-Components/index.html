=== Instructions ===

0. comment out previous html - we'll want it to reference for later

1. use the tag <product-component> to display the components current html template

2. add a v-for (with your products array) to your component to display it multiple times

3. add a prop for each product info (image, title, description, price)
    3.1  change the component's html to display that information (use the last warmup's html for reference)
    


=== If you've finished the above ===

4. Use a single prop, one that accepts the entire product object
    (you can then access each piece)
